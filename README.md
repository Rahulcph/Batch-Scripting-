Desktop File Email Automation üìß
This project is a Windows batch script that automates the process of sending an email with all the files from your desktop as attachments. It leverages a temporary PowerShell script for email functionality and supports SMTP configurations like Gmail and Outlook.

üìñ Features
Automatically retrieves all files from the Desktop directory.
Sends the files as email attachments using an SMTP server.
Temporary PowerShell script is dynamically generated for execution.
Credentials are embedded (but should be stored securely‚Äîsee notes below).
üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
Windows Environment:

The script is designed for Windows and uses PowerShell for email functionality.
SMTP Configuration:

Configure your SMTP settings, such as server, port, email, and password, in the script.
PowerShell Execution Policy:

Ensure PowerShell scripts can be executed by bypassing the policy:
bash
Kopier kode
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
üöÄ Usage
Clone or download the script:

bash
Kopier kode
git clone https://github.com/username/email-automation.git
cd email-automation
Open the batch script (email_automation.bat) in a text editor.

Modify the PowerShell parameters:

Update the following placeholders with your details:
plaintext
Kopier kode
$EmailFrom = "your-email@gmail.com"
$EmailTo = "recipient-email@gmail.com"
$SMTPUser = "your-email@gmail.com"
$SMTPPass = "your-password"
$SMTPServer = "smtp.your-email-provider.com"
$SMTPPort = 587
Save and run the batch script:

bash
Kopier kode
email_automation.bat
The script will:

Generate a temporary PowerShell script.
Attach all files from the Desktop.
Send the email.
Clean up the temporary script.
‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notes
Email Password:
The password is stored in plain text in the script, which is insecure. Consider using a secure credential vault or environment variables to manage sensitive data.

PowerShell Execution Policy:
The script uses -ExecutionPolicy Bypass, which allows PowerShell scripts to run unrestricted. Ensure you understand the security implications of this setting.

SMTP Configuration:
Use app-specific passwords or OAuth tokens if supported by your email provider.

üí° Example
Desktop Files
Suppose the Desktop contains:

report.pdf
image.jpg
The script will:

Collect these files.
Send an email with both files attached.
Notify you of the status.
üß© File Structure
email_automation.bat: The main batch script that generates and executes the PowerShell script.
‚ú® Customization
Subject and Body:
Modify the $Subject and $Body variables in the PowerShell section to fit your email content:

plaintext
Kopier kode
$Subject = "Custom Subject"
$Body = "Your custom email body text."
File Filters:
Update the Get-ChildItem command to include filters for specific file types:

powershell
Kopier kode
$Files = Get-ChildItem -Path $DesktopPath -Filter *.pdf
